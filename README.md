# Cyber_Security_Intrusion_Prevention

## Overview of Topic:

We are using a `machine learning model` to detect factors that contribute to `DDoS` cyber attacks in an effort to limit the vulnerability of the average consumer.

## Why did we chose this topic? 

Living in a digital age, Cybersecurity is not only necessary but crucial. Preparedness is key to swiftly detecting and remedying an attack. Preventative measures can help secure information on a scale of one's social security information through threatening national security. We chose this topic to inform the general public of DDoS attacks, the common variables associated, and preventative measure they can take.

## Description of our source data:

- Intrusion Detection Evaluation Dataset (CIC-IDS2017) from the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. 

Description taken from [Data Source](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html):

"The CICIDS2017 dataset consists of labeled network flows, including full packet payloads in pcap format, the corresponding profiles and the labeled flows (GeneratedLabelledFlows.zip) and CSV files for machine and deep learning purposes."

## Questions we are seeking to answer with our data:

1. How does a DDoS attack happen?

2. What does a DDoS attack affect?

3. Who is the target audience for DDoS attacks?

4. What preventative measures can be taken to protect the average user from a malicious DDoS attack?



## Communication Protocols:

We currently meet twice weekly and continue to communicate as needed through Slack.
